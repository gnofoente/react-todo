This is a simple to-do app built with **React** and bootstrapped with **Next.js**.

The main goal here is to constantly upgrade it as I dig deeper into React concepts.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
